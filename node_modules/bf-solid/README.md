# solid

Solid is a base style library. It will be used as the core styling for Buzzfeed products. For more details check out the [Solid Docs](http://solid.buzzfeed.com/).

## Including Solid in Your Project

### Dependencies
You must have NPM installed. If you have installed the [Buzzfeed webapp](https://github.com/buzzfeed/buzzfeed) congrats! You already do.

### Install
When inside your project directory type:
```
npm install bf-solid --save
```
or using Bower:
```
bower install git+ssh://git@github.com/buzzfeed/solid.git#<RELEASE_VERSION> --save
```

This will give you `solid.scss` and all of its scss files inside `node_modules/solid/lib`. This package includes the static, uncompiled SCSS files. Whether you want to build them into your project with Grunt, Gulp, etc. is up to you.

### Grunt Usage

#### (with grunt-sass)

Grunt-sass uses libsass to compile your sass. Use includePaths to make solid available as an scss import.

```
  sass: {
    dist: {
      options: {
        includePaths: 'node_modules/bf-solid/lib'
      },
      files: {
        'path/to/output.css': 'path/to/input.scss'
      }
    }
});
```

Then in your scss import file import solid with `@import "solid";`

## Solid Structure
Solid is broken up into four sections:
+ solid-helpers (variables and mixins used by all imports)
+ solid-base (normalize + base element styles)
+ solid-utilities (utility classes)
+ solid-components (utility classes that require specific HTML markup)

You can get everything with `@import "solid";`. Individual sections can also be imported. For example if you want the utility classes just `@import "solid-utilities";`

## Building the Solid Styleguide
The solid styleguide lets you view Solid along with all of its documentation.

## Set Up the Styleguide Locally (optional)

### Dependencies

This installation guide assumes that you have the [Buzzfeed webapp](https://github.com/buzzfeed/buzzfeed) installed. That will set you up with the correct versions of node and ruby.

### Downloading the repo

Open a terminal window. Clone the repo into a new folder:

`git clone git@github.com:buzzfeed/solid.git /opt/buzzfeed/solid`

Move into that directory

`cd /opt/buzzfeed/solid`

### Prepare required directories

```bash
[ ! -d /buzzfeed ] && sudo mkdir -p /buzzfeed && sudo chown `id -u`:`id -g` /buzzfeed
```

### Build the app

Build Solid's dependencies

`make dev`

### Run locally

`make run`

Open the site in your web browser:

<http://localhost:9000/>

## Linting

We use scss lint to keep our scss clean and consistent.

To run scss_lint:

`scss-lint scss/`

## Code Snippets

To add code snippets/highlighted syntax to pages in solid, wrap your markup inside <%= ' ' %>
```
<pre>
    <code><%= 'markup here' %></code>
</pre>
```


**Examples**

To add documentation to an `<h2>` in html

```
<pre>
    <code> <%= '<h2> Sentence Here </h2>' %> </code>
</pre>
```


To add documentation to a `<p>` in html with class `.text-1`

```
<pre>
    <code> <%= '<p class="text-1"> Yale Will Offer Its First Online Degree </p>' %> </code>
</pre>
```


To add documentation to the `$text-2` variable in css:

```
<pre>
    <code class="css"> <%= ".class { font-size: $text-1; }" %> </code>
</pre>
```


To add documentation to an `<h2>` in html, a `<p>` in html with class `.text-1`, and the `$text-1` variable in css all in the same `<pre>` tag:

```
<pre>
    <code class="html"> <%= '<h1> Yale Will Offer Its First Online Degree </h1>' %> <br /> <%= '<p class="text-1"> Yale Will Offer Its First Online Degree </p>' %> </code>
    <code class="css"> <%= ".class { font-size: $text-1; }" %> </code>
</pre>
```
